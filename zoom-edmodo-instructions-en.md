* in order to start an online lesson click ‘New Meeting’

* ZOOM offers an electronic board (`Whiteboard`), which can be used during your lesson; in order to enable this, click on `Share screen -> Whiteboard` (this function only works during the lesson)

* **When conducting online lessons, teachers should continue to fill in the attendance registers.**


We use Zoom  in a free mode, therefore the meeting may end automatically and without warning 40 minutes after the third participant had joined it. The teachers are therefore advised to conform to the following rules:
1. the teacher should not start the meeting long before the start of the lesson
2. the lesson starts from the moment the teacher is connected - you should not wait for "latecomers"
3. the teacher should keep track of time (ideally by using a timer / stopwatch) in order to finish the lesson in a courteous manner whenever possible.
