# Cambridge Russian School: Coronavirus (COVID-19)
<!--
## Brief overview of the situation (21:23, March 13, 2020)
Cambridge Russian School is a Saturday supplementary school. Education at the School takes place on Saturdays and involves attending classes at the school (face-to-face education). The school is attended by adults and children.
On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19) a global pandemic. The situations in various countries are changing rapidly and the measures taken by governments, local government bodies and health care organisations differ. At present, the British government does not consider it effective to cease teaching in educational institutions across the country (including children's schools) and to close them, while it does not exclude that such a measure can be applied in the following weeks and / or months. Some universities have decided to temporarily switch to distance learning, but they have made these decisions independently.

## The operation of the Russian School from March 14 to April 4, 2020
The Board of Trustees and the administration of the Cambridge Russian School are monitoring the evolving situation associated with the coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19). The official position of the School is as follows:

 * The School will continue its normal operation and the provision of lessons with their face-to-face attendance at its official address (Long Road Sixth Form College, Long Road, Cambridge, CB2 8PX) until at least one of the following events occurs:

 1. The central government or the regional administration orders to close all schools in the country or the region.
 2. Long Road Sixth Form College bans the access to its premises for reasons related to the epidemiological situation.
 3. There is an officially confirmed case of coronavirus infection among students, parents or staff.

 * During the entire period when the School operates normally, with the provision of face-to-face classes, the parents’/carers’ decision not to attend classes does not entail a recalculation of tuition fees.
 * In the event that the functioning of the School in normal mode with the provision of face-to-face classes is temporarily impossible, the School will ensure continuity of education and continue providing classes in the form of distance learning where the school administration considers it feasible. The decision which classes are going to run will be made jointly by the administration and teachers, and a complete list of such classes will be published in a timely manner. The schedule of online lessons will follow the current school timetable, and class lists will remain unchanged. The parents’/carers’ decision not to attend the online lessons provided by the School does not entail a recalculation of tuition fees.
 * The fees paid for the lessons which cannot be taught remotely will be transferred to the next trimester.
 * In case of temporary and necessary transition to distance learning, the School will use the online conferences platform [ZOOM](https://zoom.us/). In order to use this platform, the teachers need to register on the site [https://zoom.us/](https://zoom.us/) and install Zoom on their home computers; registration is not required for the parents, but they also need to install Zoom on their home computers.

[More detailed instructions are here.](https://github.com/mathmusci/camrusschool-covid-19-contingency/blob/master/zoom-edmodo-instructions.md)

The parents
 * install ZOOM on their home computers in advance (no later than 19 March)

[More detailed instructions are here.](https://github.com/mathmusci/camrusschool-covid-19-contingency/blob/master/zoom-edmodo-instructions.md)
